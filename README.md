# Parallel Computing - Second project (parallel version)

This repository will contain the second project for the Parallel Computing course.

The project I choose to explore is Kernel Image Processing.
This repository will contain a single thread version implemented written in C++17 with the aid of NVIDIA CUDA and the open source library LodePNG.
